Minimal Data Platform 
---

<!-- column_layout: [1, 1] -->

<!-- column: 0 -->
# Data Lake

Unstructured Data migrated from application layer. Usually object storage with minimal metadata files.

# ETL

Tools for data processing focused on processing capacity and performance. 
Should have simple api for data interaction and access to  orchestration tools.

<!-- column: 1 -->
# Stream Processing

It holds  similar value with ETL but is optimized for real time data processing.
Used where action is taken based on real time data and workflow orchestration.


# Visualization

Tools for generating visualizations from data already processed. Need to offer simple interface and options for multiple complex visualizations and analysis.

<!-- reset_layout -->
<!-- pause -->
# AI and ML Platform

Out of ETL and Stream Processing workflows, we add a new layer for AI and ML. AI in data analytics is just another type of transaformation.

- Data classification.
- Models training. 
- Storage for Models.
- Models will be used in workflows to predict and classify data on the stream processing layer, raise alerts and trigger actions for anomaly detection, and many more use cases.
